        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 30/07/25</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in relation to the message summarization bot ("the Bot") available via our open-source GitHub repository.</p>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>The Bot is maintained as project by Dodo-alone. You may contact via GitHub if you have any questions.</p>

        <h2>2. What Data We Process</h2>
        <p>The Bot accesses and processes group chat messages for the sole purpose of generating summaries.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We do not store or retain message contents.</li>
            <li>Only display names (not user IDs or permanent identifiers) are used and only during runtime.</li>
            <li>No personal identifiers are logged or stored.</li>
            <li>Error and configuration logs may be collected to improve functionality, but do not contain personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Legal Basis</h2>
        <p>Under the GDPR, our legal basis for processing is <strong>legitimate interest</strong> where the privacy impact is minimal and users are informed via notice.</p>

        <p>Where applicable, group administrators who install or authorize the Bot agree to inform users that their messages may be processed.</p>

        <h2>4. User Controls</h2>
        <p>The Bot may include an <code>!optout</code> command allowing individual users to exclude their messages from summarization. Where enabled, we store minimal hashed identifiers solely to honor this request.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>No personal data is shared with third parties. Messages are sent to the Google Gemini API for summarization only with anonymous user display names, and processed per Google's own privacy and safety policies.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request access, correction, or deletion of any data we may hold. In practice, since we store no message data, this typically does not apply â€” but you can contact us via GitHub if needed.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This policy may be updated over time. Check this page for the latest version.</p>
