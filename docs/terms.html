        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 30/07/25</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By using the message summarization bot ("the Bot") or installing it in a group chat, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The Bot summarizes recent group chat messages to help users catch up on missed conversations. It uses Google’s Gemini API to generate these summaries.</p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Group administrators are responsible for informing members about the Bot’s functionality.</li>
            <li>You may not use the Bot to process illegal, abusive, or sensitive personal data without appropriate safeguards and consent.</li>
            <li>You must not attempt to reverse-engineer, manipulate, or bypass the Bot's safety features or those provided by the Google Gemini API.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Handling</h2>
        <p>No message data is stored. Anonymized content is temporarily processed via the Google Gemini API. Error logs and configuration actions may be stored solely for debugging purposes.</p>

        <h2>5. API Usage Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The Bot relies on third-party services (Google Gemini API). We are not responsible for outages, errors, or data handling practices on Google's side.</p>

        <h2>6. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to discontinue the Bot, restrict access, or remove functionality at any time without notice.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>This Bot is provided "as-is", without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any indirect or consequential damages arising from its use.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>These terms may be updated periodically. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of the latest version.</p>
